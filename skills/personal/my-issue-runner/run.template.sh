# Works a queue of Issues. One orchestrator per Issue, then it exits. The next
# orchestrator starts fresh. State lives on line 1 of each Issue file, so an
# interrupted run picks up where it stopped.
#
# Each Issue runs on a harness: claude, opencode, or cursor's agent CLI. The
# default harness and model live in ~/.issue-runner, read every time the
# runner starts. A per-Issue override lives in assign_for below the marker.
#
#   ./run.sh              work the queue until it halts
#   ./run.sh status       print the board, change nothing
#   ./run.sh next         print which Issue would run next
#   ./run.sh reset NN     put Issue NN back to ready
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  the queue finished, or nothing is runnable
#   1  a preflight refusal, such as a dirty worktree
#   2  an Issue reached a checkpoint and needs you
#   3  an Issue ended without setting its own status
#
# Environment overrides:
#   RUNNER_MAX_ISSUES   safety stop           (default: set below the marker)
#
# Everything above the CONFIG marker is the engine. It is identical in every
# runner /my-issue-runner generates, and that sameness is the point: leave it
# alone. To pick up a newer engine, run the skill again on this directory. It
# replaces above the marker and leaves your config below it untouched.
